          <p><i>Opportunities for employment training while attending Federal Way High Schools</i></p>
          <p>
              Career and Technical Education (CTE) is the latest jargon for what we used to call
              Vocational Training. Under new Federal regulations funding for these programs must be
              for “Sequential Courses” in the same field. No longer can one simply take a course for a
              Vocational Credit. This is where the major growth in living wage employment will be, not
              in college graduates. 
              <br><br>
              For Federal Way students to take full advantage of these opportunities the courses will
              need to have the endorsement of living wage employers who are willing to hire high
              school graduates who have the necessary basic training for their skill areas. With few
              exceptions, there is little evidence of school-employer partnerships in Federal Way
              schools.
              <br><br>
              In addition, in neighboring districts with multiple high schools, there is transportation
              offered for students to attend a CTE program in another high school. In Federal Way
              their only option is to 'choice in' full time to the school offering the program of interest
              <br><br>
              and provide their own transportation. It is also not clear to all parents and students what
              CTE programs are offered in the district or at what schools.

            <p><i>Puget Sound Skills Center</i></p>
            <p>
                PSSC is one of 20 skills centers in Washington state, offering high-quality, tuition-free
                technical and professional training to high school juniors and seniors. Operated by
                Highline Public Schools, PSSC serves students from Highline, Federal Way, Tukwila
                and Tahoma school districts. Students from Federal Way must apply to participate in
                this program as a part of this consortium. PSSC offers courses listed at
                highlineschools.org.
                <br><br>
                Students spend half of their school day in their home high schools, and half the day at
                PSSC where they are offered 18 programs, from aerospace manufacturing to animation
                to fashion design to certified nursing assistant and much more. Students earn high
                school and college credits in a hands-on, workplace-oriented environment. PSSC
                students graduate with certifications and job-ready skills - and a jumpstart on further
                college and career training.
                <br><br>
                It is unclear how closely related PSSC programs are to local living wage employers.
                Even with this option Federal Way Schools still need more robust offerings of
                “Employer” endorsed programs for all students.
                <br><br>
                Unlike some states that have highly organized educational programs, Washington
                state has neglected any serious vocational training. Some of the most sophisticated
                manufacturing in the world takes place in the state of Washington yet we are not
                making use of it. There are no differentiated diplomas permitted in this state which
                would allow for varying degrees and variety of achievement. And no vocational high
                schools.
