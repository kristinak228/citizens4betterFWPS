          <p><i>Opportunities for employment training while attending Federal Way High Schools</i></p>
          <p>
            Career and Technical Education (CTE) is the latest jargon for what we used to call Vocational Training.  
            Under new Federal regulations funding for these programs must be for “Sequential Courses” in the same field.  
            No longer can one simply take a course for a Vocational Credit.”
            This is where the major growth in living wage employment will be, not in college graduates.
            However, for Federal Way students to take full advantage of these opportunities the courses will need to have 
            the endorsement of living wage employers who are willing to hire high school graduates that have the necessary 
            basic training for their processes.
            With few exceptions there is little evidence of any school-employer partnerships in Federal Way schools.  
            In addition, unlike in neighboring districts with multiple high schools there is no transportation offered for 
            students in one high school to attend a CTE program of their interest in another high school.

            <p>
                The Federal Way School District is a member of this consortium.  
                The Center offers course listed as this site: <a href="https://pssc.highlineschools.org/programs" target="_blank">highlineschools.org</a>.  
                It is unclear, here as well, how closely related these programs are related to local living wage employers.  
                They are, however, two-year courses that give students employable skills.
                Federal Way School District’s “College Ready” rate according to USNews is 11.2%.  
                If It were twice this rate we would still need more robust offerings of “Employer” endorsed programs.
