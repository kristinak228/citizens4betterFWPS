            If you are planning on your child attending college, there are several facts you need to
            know prior to your child entering high school.
            <br><br>
            Does your child have a graduation plan? Many very successful high schools have several
            graduation plans to choose from!
            <br>

            <ol>
              <li>High School Guidance. High school Guidance Counselors have approximately 400
                  students each and spend a good deal of their time working with struggling students.
                  This leaves little time for serious planning of all students who think that they are
                  headed for college.</li>
                
              <li>If financial aid is an issue it is very important that your student is a known by
                  the schools that can afford them. This is a process that needs to start in the 8th
                  grade. It is not what college your student knows; it is what colleges know of your
                  student. There are lots of colleges looking for Washington students!</li>
            </ol>

            There are monthly seminars on college planning offered in Federal Way that will teach
            students how to plan for college and win many possible, available scholarships.
            Motto: "Court the school of your choice until the school of your choice courts you!"
            For more information on monthly seminars, college planning and scholarships please leave
            your name, email address, and message in the feedback section of this website.
