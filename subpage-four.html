        <p>
            If you are planning on your child attending college there are several facts you need to know <b>prior to your child entering high school.</b>
            
            <br>Does your child have a graduation plan prior to entering high school?  
            Many very successful high schools have these!
            <br>

            <ol>
              <li>High School Guidance. High school Guidance Counselors have approximately 400 students each and spend a good deal of their time working with struggling students.  
                This leaves little time for serious planning of all students who think that they are headed for college.</li>
                
              <li>If financial aid is an issue it is very important that your student is a known quanity at schools that can afford them.  
                This is a process that need to start in the 8th grade.  
                It is not what college your student knows; it is what colleges know of your student.  
                There are lots of colleges looking for Washington students!</li>
            </ol>

            <br>There are monthly seminars on college planning in Federal Way.
