          <p><i>School Quality</i></p>
          <p>
              The quality of school’s effects not only the children living in the community.  
              Perhaps more importantly it effects real estate prices!  
              Real estate professionals will tell you that if a family is looking to buy a house and askes the salesman 
              for their opinion on schoo’ls they will refer them to <a href="https://www.greatschools.org" target="_blank">Great Schools</a>
              Often that either makes the deal or squashes the deal.  
              High schools rated “3” located near ones rated “7” may not be a good choice.
              There is often the suggestion that crime and drugs are more common in areas with poor schools.
              Clearly good schools are an attraction to possible home buyers.

              Statement from a local realtor:
              <blockquote>I run into, I'd say every couple with kids, but it may not be every... 
              but let's say the vast majority of parents, when they're looking for a new home, ask about the schools.  
              Schools are a driving force for their new home location.  As I'm looking at homes... 
              with more buyers gravitating to good school areas... that drives up the price of a home... 
              it increases its 'market value'... 
              so, there will be a variety of reasons for one home to be priced higher than another home, but good schools are a 
              uge value when it comes to assessing the market value of one's home, and comparing prices from one 
              area to another.  In WA, the home price difference between school districts can be significant.  
              Very significant.  
              And home buyers use a website called <a href="https://www.greatschools.org" target="_blank">Great Schools</a> or they will look at the US News stats... 
              and talk to residents at a coffee shop as well.  Kids today are competing on a national scale for scholarships, etc... 
              so the value of a home in a good school area has only increased over the years.</blockquote>
