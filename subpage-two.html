          <p><i>School Quality</i></p>
          <p>
              The quality of our public schools doesn’t just affect the students of our community but
              has a direct effect on our real estate prices. Real estate professionals advise clients
              shopping for a new home to consult the website greatschools.org for specific
              information on the schools in their prospective neighborhood. A school rated 1 to 3 may
              lead a home buyer to look elsewhere for a school district where the schools are rated
              far better. Districts neighboring Federal way boast schools rated much above 1 to 3.
              
              There is frequently the assumption that crime is more prevalent in areas with poorer
              schools. Well rated schools are a clear attraction for prospective home buyers, for
              prospective businesses, and a boon to the local economy.

            <p> 
              A local realtor puts it this way:
              <blockquote>
                The vast majority of parents, when they're looking for a new home, ask about the
                schools. With more buyers gravitating to good school areas it drives up the price of a
                home, increasing its 'market value'. Good schools make a difference when comparing
                prices from one area to another. In WA, the home price difference between school
                districts can be significant. Very significant. Home buyers use a website called 
                <a href="https://www.greatschools.org" target="_blank">Great Schools</a> or they will 
                look at the US News stats and talk to residents at a coffee shop asvwell. Kids today 
                are competing on a national scale for scholarships, etc. The value of a home in a 
                good school area only increases over the years.
