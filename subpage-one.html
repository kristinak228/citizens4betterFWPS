            This organization ranks almost every public school in the nation and gives a score from 1 (Oh my) to 10 (Superior).  
            Federal Way has schools ranking from “1” to about “7”.  
            A word of caution in using this site.  
            Schools are sorted by the address of the school, not by districts. 
            The Federal Way School District has schools in Federal Way, Auburn, Kent, and Des Moines.  
            Our four high schools are ranked either a “3” or “4”. 
            Nearby districts have schools ranked as high as “7.”  
            You will want to take note of proficiency levels.

            <a href="https://www.greatschools.org" target="_blank">GreatSchools.org</a> is the resource that most realtors and prospective businesses use

                This site will show your proficiency rates for each school as well as attendance and graduation rates for the school district and individual high schools.
                It is data such as this that prompts the need for this website.

            USNews ranks all major high schools in the Nation.  
            It is clear on what criteria it uses.  
            Federal Way’s best high school is ranked “141st” in the State of Washington.  
            It is interesting to look at the “141st” high schools in other states to get a picture of where this state stands.  
            You may be disappointed in some of these comparisons.  
            Massachusetts is about the same size as Washington.  
            Check out the 141st best high school in Massachusetts statistics next to Federal Way’s 141st best.  
            Check proficiency levels here also.  Please note the “College Readiness” rates for high schools.

          <p>The particularly low achievement levels in our high schools suggests to me that our middle schools, and perhaps our
              elementary schools are promoting kids that cannot do the work of a high schooler. It is unlikely that this problem began in
              high school.</p>
